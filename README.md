## Code Sources
    I worked with two other students, Will F. and James M. in order to add switch functions to the code. I also used the following sources to help me with the code: my TA's and an old README project.

### Notes
    For my personal addage, I've generated an icon for the app itself, as seen above.  I used chapGPT, it is not what i intend to be graded on it was just for fun extending what i had learned.  I created the circles myself, then researched how to use a feature of css within my icon, then based on that I decided an animation would be fun.  I used chatGPT to help me configure the rotation for the circles, then using that, I had gpt generate a small unique icon using paths.  I then added the animation to the new paths.  I just wanted to clarify that this is not what I intend to be graded on, it was just for fun.  I hope you enjoy it!
